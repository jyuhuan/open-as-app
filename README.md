## Open as App
This automator asks Chrome to open any URL as a native-like app. 

### How to Use
Upon opening this app, it will ask for the URL to open. Enter any URL, and click OK (or hit enter). 

Use this automator to avoid seeing the address bar, and to have a native feeling while browsing web sites that design their pages like apps.
